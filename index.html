        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        
        <p>Greetings everyone!<br>
            I am Yogyata Dangal and I will be turning 16 this year. I recently completed Grade 10 from Daffodil Boarding School.<br>
            I have always had a keen interest in music although I could never actually sing. Amidst all the uncertainty and chaos, I’ve began writing poems and other articles during the widespread pandemic. Just the sense of satisfaction that comes from expressing my heart out gives me immense pleasure. <br><br>
            I’ve yet to figure out what I want to do in my life but I want to end up working in a bank. I wish to travel round the globe. I absolutely love learning new things and meeting new people. <br><br>Thank you for checking my website out. If you like my articles, do leave me a message on any of my social media handles. <br><br>
            Thank you. Have a wonderful day! </p>

                                But why are the troubles faced by women <br>
                                during their monthly cycle, unheard? </p>
                            
                            <p> No, menstruating isn't dirty;<br>
                                It's just a cyclic process that goes on and on<br>
                                that makes a woman fecund<br>
                                and allows her to embrace her fertility.</p>

                                it is the very reason <br>
                                for you and i, to exist.</p>
                            
                            <p> Enough of the whispers while talking about it.<br>
                                Enough of the pads wrapped up in plastics. <br>
                                It's high time, stop the menstruation taboos<br>
                                and boycott the demeaning norms and values.</p>
                            
                            <p> For normalizing this, prioritize 'menstrual education'.<br>

                                For menstruation is nothing but a process<br>

                <img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5b2586e41aef1d89f00c60a9/1569263464826-MTLNLZNTEK4D2D9J7GJW/sdg+13+grande+en.jpg?format=1000w">
                <p>To put it simply, Climate Action is goal no. 13 of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals
                    established by the United Nations in 2015. The official wording is to "Take urgent action
                    to combat climate change and its impacts". According to the United Nations, Climate action
                    means stepped-up efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and strengthen resilience and
                    adaptive capacity to climate-induced impacts.</p>
                
                <p>As we are very well aware, climate change is undoubtedly affecting every country on every continent.
                 It is disrupting national economies and affecting lives. Weather patterns are changing, sea levels are rising,
                 and weather events are becoming more extreme. Even during the pandemic, climate change is not on pause.
                  Once the global economy begins to recover from the pandemic, emissions are expected to return to higher levels.</p>
                  
                <p>If climate action is not taken, today’s youths will be tomorrow’s sufferers.
                     For battling climate change in Nepal, youths must get involved in initiating or volunteering with environmental organizations such as Nepalese Youth For Climate Action (NYCA);
                     participating in tree planting and go-green activities; garbage picking and recycling initiatives;
                     using social media for promoting climate action and environmental awareness to the public;
                     limiting the use of plastics; walking or biking in short distances instead of riding fueled vehicles; 
                     segregating garbage at home and lastly, encouraging our friends, schoolmates and our family to do what we are doing.</p>

            <div class="rape"> <li><b>Rape</b><br>
                    <img src="https://static.theprint.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/5827890190_26a0466f91_b.jpg">
                <p> 'We live in a society that teaches women to be careful not to get raped instead of teaching men not to rape.'</p>
                <p>Rape, simply speaking, is the only crime where the victim becomes the accused. Rape cases have reached to its peak with the global pandemic. Women are facing abusive partners and teenagers are getting victimized day by day. Amit Abraham once said that, rape is a heinous crime than murder since the rape victim dies throughout the period she lives. Though her body may heal, her soul will have sustained a damage beyond compensation.</p>
                <p>In our patriarchal society, whenever we hear about rape, the first thing that people talk about is the size of a woman’s dress. If she was asking for “it”. If she had dressed in a slutty way. If she was too flirty. But it’s high time for us to understand that the only cause of rape are the rapists. That the shame is not the victim’s. The shame is reserved for each creep who has ever touched a female inappropriately. The abuser is to be shamed, not the victim.</p>
                <p>Statistics show that one in five women will be sexually assaulted during her lifetime. From a global perspective 683,000 women are forcibly raped each year. This number equals about 56,000 women a month, 1,800 women each day, and 78 women per hour. Only 16% of the cases are ever reported. According to the Nepal Police’s latest statistics, 2,144 rape cases and 687 attempts to rape cases were reported in the fiscal year 2019/20.</p>
                <p>Rape is a silent epidemic and rape cases are often not reported because of societal shame or lack of courage. A rape victim suffers an unimaginable level of pain physically, mentally and psychologically. A 13 years old was found raped and murdered in Kanchanpur and was thrown in a sugarcane field. It has been years and no proper justice has been served. The worst case that I’ve heard is about a 12-year-old girl who was raped by as many as 30 men over two years in Kerala, India. According to the Nepal Police, around 307 rape cases have been registered in Bagmati Province during the fiscal year 2077/78. </p>
                <p>I would like to conclude this essay with a poem:<br>
                    How would you feel if your daughter’s mouth was taped? <br>
                    When she wanted to scream her heart out whilst her body ached <br>
                    How would you feel if your sister got raped?<br>
                    It’s not ok, what part of it do you not get?</p>

            <div class="covid">
                <li><b>COVID-19 for me</b></li>
                <img src="New folder/covid.jpg">
                <p>I remember my school-life being absolutely joyful, always. And like any other teenager, I never wished for it to
                    come to an end. I had always heard that grade 10 is the most memorable segment of student life. And right when I
                    almost got promoted to grade 10, COVID-19 happened! </p>
                <p> Since then, my life took a drastic turn. From going to school half-asleep at 7 in the morning to waking up at 10 
                    am hurriedly to join online classes, my lifestyle was completely modified. I couldn’t meet my friends for longer 
                    than I had anticipated. And amidst all this uncertainty and chaos caused due to the pandemic, I felt lost. For a 
                    long time. I was supposed to be living the best part of my life at that moment. But there I was, at my home, 
                    watching some critically-acclaimed TV series which didn’t even interest me. </p>
                <p>I’m pretty sure this is the story of many students like me. Surely, being home for months had some merits too. 
                    But the time that I missed in my institution, the days which were supposed to be the golden days of my life, were 
                    lost. All the fun things, the hikes, the picnics, going on tours, celebrating children’s day, taking part in
                    competitions, stupid group fights, the fear of SEE approaching whilst the feeling of nostalgia dripping down our 
                    necks as our school life was coming to an end- I missed it. We missed it. And nothing can bring that back. </p>
                <p>So, with all that COVID-19 has taught and how it has affected us, I hate this impact that it brought upon me and 
                    everyone in a similar situation. I really hope for this to come to an end so that we can live the way we used to.<br>
                    Happily. <br>
